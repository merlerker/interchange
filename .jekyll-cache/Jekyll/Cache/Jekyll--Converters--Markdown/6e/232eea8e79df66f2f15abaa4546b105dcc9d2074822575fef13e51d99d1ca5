I"<p>I am a fifth year B.Arch student with minors in Intelligent Environments and Physical Computing. This unique mixture of education has given me the ability to take projects from ideation, to actualization, to post-actualization analysis. I want to dedicate my life to positive social impact, whether through design, built structures, art or providing a necessary service to fulfill that. Being from Kuwait, I am very passionate about working with refugees and displaced people, and fighting for womenâ€™s rights and women empowerment.</p>
