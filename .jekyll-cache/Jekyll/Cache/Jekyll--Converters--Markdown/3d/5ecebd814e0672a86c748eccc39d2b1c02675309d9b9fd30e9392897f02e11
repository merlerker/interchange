I"7<p>My name is Irfan Haider, and I am a 5th year BARCH student. I am from NYC and am looking for full time work in the city. My interests range from fabrication design and construction administration to high-rise design and affordable housing. In my spare time I am an avid woodworker and basketball savant.</p>
