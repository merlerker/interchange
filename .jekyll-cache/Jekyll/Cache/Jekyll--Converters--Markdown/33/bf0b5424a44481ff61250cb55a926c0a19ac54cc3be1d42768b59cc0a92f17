I"®<p>I am a Fifth-Year B.Arch candidate interested in learning about the relationships between material explorations and design practices. More specifically, my Graduating Thesis is focused reevaluating our approach to design through an increased sensitivity to how the manifestation of built space can impact people with Sensory Processing Challenges. My goal is to further develop these strategies in a professional practice.</p>
