I"$<p>Iâ€™m currently a fourth-year pursuing a B.Arch. in the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University. I am passionate about design as art driven by necessity and the impact that buildings have on shaping the identity of cities and in turn, the lives of people. I am very interested in Cultural, Public and large-scale architecture. I have an interest in innovative structural design and thoroughly enjoy learning about building systems. Outside of academics, I devote my time to Fresh Check Day, Peer Health Advocates and CMU NOMAS.</p>
