I"Å<p>Second-year M.Arch student, looking for a full-time position in an architecture firm. I graduated with a B.Arch degree in 2016 from Manipal University, India and worked for a year as a junior architect at a Real Estate and Construction firm, after a short freelance job as a design consultant for a Healthcare and Nutrition consultancy firm. My previous experience during my education has included internships and short-term projects with firms that worked in the fields of conservation, product design, architecture and construction, interior design, healthcare and most recently, online publication/curatorship, each having given me a wide range of skills that have aided my architectural education.</p>
