I"M<p>Hi! I’m currently a fourth-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Architecture. I’m excited about problem solving today’s environmental and societal issues through beautiful design. When I’m not in studio, you can find me looking for a good cup of coffee (like the true Seattleite that I am), hiking, or taking pictures.</p>
