I";<p>I am a fifth year B.Arch. student with a double-minor in Architectural History and Intelligent Environments. My multi-disciplinary education allows me to incorporate my avocation and observations of the world around me into my architectural work. I believe that architecture is a rich field that directly affects the way that people live and its roots in history and the natural environment must be acknowledged and respected.</p>

<p>Outside of architecture, my interests include history, public policy, performance art, biology, movies, writing, and crocheting.</p>
