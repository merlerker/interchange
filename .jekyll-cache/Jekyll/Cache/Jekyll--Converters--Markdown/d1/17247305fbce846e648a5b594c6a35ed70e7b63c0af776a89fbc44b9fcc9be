I"ê<p>Hello! I am a 5th year Bachelor of Architecture Undergraduate and 1st year Master of Science in Sustainable Design student at CMU. Growing up in 3 different countries that varied greatly from one another, I came to recognize and appreciate the role of nature in our built environment and our social fabric. Through my pursuit of sustainability in architectural practice, I have developed passion for social resilience, circular economy, systems thinking, ecological design, and computational simulations in architectural practice. I strive to integrate these different aspects into my work to produce a positive impact environmentally and socially.</p>
