I"	<p>Hi! My name is Rachel Lu, and I am a graduating 5th year B.Arch student. I was born and raised in New York City, so I have a strong interest in designing in urban cities, spending most of my last two years on housing design in the cities of Pittsburgh, New York City, and Porto. I am also interested in architectural publication and curation. This past year, I produced the EX-CHANGE publication for the School of Architecture, and I am on the editorial board of interâ€¢punct, a student journal for architecture.</p>
