I"‰<p>My name is Tanvi, and I am a fifth-year undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. After I receive my B. Arch in May 2021, I will graduate with my MSSD in May 2022. I am looking for a summer internship for the summer of 2021 that will help me gain experience in large scale sustainable design. After graduation, I hope to gain enough AXP hours to become a licensed architect.</p>
