I"†<p>I am currently a first year student in the Master of Architecture. My interests include High Performance Building design. For which I am focusing on sustainable architecture and computational architecture courses through studies. I want my work to thrive in an interdisciplinary environment that fosters creativity and responsiveness towards energy efficiency of the building. 
I am interested in internship opportunities with an architectural firm where I can work on an integrated design approach through exploration and simulation. I am especially interested in working on climate responsive design strategies for energy conservation.</p>
