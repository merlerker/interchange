I"<p>Hi, my name is Jamie Ho. Iâ€™m from Hong Kong and currently a third year Bachelor of Architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a detail-oriented person who is interested in architecture that designs for the human experience and tells a story about the occupants through the fine details embedded within the architecture. Aside from architecture, I am also planning to pursue a secondary major in Human Computer Interaction with a minor in the concentration of Animation &amp; Special Effects.</p>
