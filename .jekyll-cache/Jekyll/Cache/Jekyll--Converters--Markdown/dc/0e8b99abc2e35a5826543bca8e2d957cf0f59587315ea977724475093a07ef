I"<p>Iâ€™m a first year B.Arch student looking for internships in architecture or construction for the summer of 2021. Before college, I focused my time on volunteer efforts to build and improve community. At architecture school, that dream is shifting from non-profit community engagement into the realm of the built environment. Along with a broad set of interests in residential, civic and educational architectures, construction and planning, I hold a broad set of digital, analog, language, and professional skills.</p>
