I"à<p>Hi! Iâ€™m a fourth year architecture student and am minoring in social and political history at Carnegie Mellon University. Iâ€™m interested in architecture that has positive impacts environmentally and socially and try to embed these notions into design through ideas of materiality and tactility. I am looking for an internship this summer as I work toward licensure and would like to gain experience at a firm which engages in work of multiple scales and program types.</p>
