I"‹<p>I am currently a junior in the B.Arch program under the School of Architecture. I am also pursuing a secondary major in Human Computer Interaction Design under the School of Computer Science. Previous projects I have been involved in include a GRAY Awards Finalist adaptive seating center in Seattle and user-centered research for a health literacy application under the HCII department. I am looking for any design internship opportunity that will broaden my experience and knowledge in user-centered design, architectural design and any other medium of design that seeks to mediate the relationship between the natural and built environment.</p>
