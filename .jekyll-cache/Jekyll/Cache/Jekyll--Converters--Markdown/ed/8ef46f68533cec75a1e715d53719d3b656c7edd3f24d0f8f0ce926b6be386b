I"Â<p>Hello, Iâ€™m Shariq.</p>

<p>I am a first generation Pakistani-American 
aspiring architect, researcher, and systems thinker 
in my 4th year of my Bachelor of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always been excited by the ability of design to craft meaningful human-centered experiences, focusing my design questions around enhancing multisensory and dynamic environments. My work explores research-centered approaches to ecological, social, and economic systems and leverages experimentation, research, and rapid iteration in order to investigate critical questions and solve problems.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not in the studio, you can find me on Spotify crafting the perfect playlist, listening to 99% Invisible, running, hiking, or biking!</p>

<p>I am a music, art, and language enthusiast, and I am always open to having quality conversations over a good cup of coffee. If youâ€™re open to a conversation, I would love to connect!</p>
