I"<p>Informed by my high school studies and a lifelong passion for drawing, I pursued a professional path in architecture by attending the B.Arch program at Carnegie Mellon University and am currently in my fourth year.</p>

<p>My art is driven by my interest in fine details and capturing the delicacy of a moment in time. This reflects in my architectural work through my sensitivity towards the client or community at large. I believe that architecture is a form of art, and that art is the most powerful movement in the world.</p>
