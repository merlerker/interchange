I"5<p>Hello! My name is Susie, and I am currently a rising third year architecture student pursuing my Bachelor of Architecture degree at Carnegie Mellon University with a double minor in Human Computer Interaction and Business Administration. As a student at CMU, I have discovered my passion for collaborating with diverse individuals and solving hybrid design problems, and believe that my past leadership and work experiences would make me a great fit to work as an Intern. I hope we have the opportunity to connect about my interests and qualifications soon!</p>
