I"Ê<p>My name is Swetha Tulluri, and I am currently pursuing my last year in the Bachelor of Architecture program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently pursuing opportunities for full-time designer roles after my graduation in May 2021. I am interested in designing buildings which maintain itâ€™s integrity throughout the development of the design; that stay true to their design concept, structure, and materiality from a larger to smaller scale.</p>
