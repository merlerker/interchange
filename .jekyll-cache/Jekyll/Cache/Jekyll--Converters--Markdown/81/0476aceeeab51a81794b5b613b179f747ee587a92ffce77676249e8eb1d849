I"y<p>I am a current a first year graduate student pursuing a Master of Advanced Architectural Design degree. I have a Bachelor degree of Engineering in Architecture and a Master degree of Architecture. I have been focused on parametric design in the past few years and have years of experience in museum, high speed rail station and landscape design. During my time at CMU, I have interested in digital fabrication, architectural robotics, interaction design and trying to use sensors to communicate with robots. I would like to explore the possibilities of interdisciplinary research and blur the boundary of architecture design.</p>
