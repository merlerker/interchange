I" <p>Cassandra Howard is passionate about bridging contemporary architecture practice and activism. This is a cause she has pursued throughout her architecture studies at Carnegie Mellon University over the past four years and through several community-engaged projects outside of the studio. She believes in the power of design as a tool for liberation and social and environmental justice for marginalized communities. As a designer, she works with and alongside communities, empowering individuals with the resources they need to improve their quality of life and build value in their communities. She will graduate this May with her Bachelor of Architecture degree.</p>
