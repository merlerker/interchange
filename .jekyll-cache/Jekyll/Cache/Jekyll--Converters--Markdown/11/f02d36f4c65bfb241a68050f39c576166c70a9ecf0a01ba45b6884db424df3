I"U<p>Sreya Tolety is a 2nd year student of the Master of Science in Sustainable Design. She is interested in the exploration of the dichotomy that exists between energy efficiency and human comfort in the built environment and often finds herself at the convergence of architecture, energy and engineering.
Much of the work that she immerses herself in entails computationally adept solutions to issues that plague the environment. She chooses to confront these by constructing generative design tools, data-informed parametric workflows and immersive environments.</p>

<p>She has worked as a Building Performance Intern at Interface Engineering where she developed Grasshopper-Python pipelines to facilitate building energy analysis and modeled future climate-change weather data for the LEED Platinum National Landing project in Northern Virginia.</p>
