I";<p>I find human behavior infinitely fascinating and am actively learning how to positively influence personal experiences. My interests lie in figuring out how to enhance the physical environment through the impact of technology. Currently I am a fourth year architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a Bachelors of Architecture with an expected graduation date of 2019. I am also in the process of obtaining a minor in Media Design through the IDeATe program and will be applying for a secondary major in Human Computer Interaction this semester.</p>
