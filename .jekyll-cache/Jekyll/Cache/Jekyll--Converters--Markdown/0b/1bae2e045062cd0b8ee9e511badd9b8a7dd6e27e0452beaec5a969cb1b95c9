I"O<p>I am currently in my first year of my Master of Architecture program at Carnegie Mellon University. The wide gamut of courses offered in my undergraduate education as well as my current curriculum at CMU has helped me gain a strong foothold on aspects such as the design development, construction technology, along with the use of parametric and computation tools.</p>

<p>However, I still feel the need to be taught by experts in the field to make a significant contribution in this domain. Therefore, a job opportunity would allow me to interact with some of the best in the industry. With the talent resource available at the architecture firms currently a part of interchange, I am confident that my learning process would be successful and exciting.</p>
