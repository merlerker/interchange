I"H<p>My name is Carmen Yu. I am currently a fifth year pursuing a Bachelors of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University (Class of 2021). Along with architecture, I have strong interests in urban design and fabrication. I am also participating in this yearâ€™s Lunar Gala in which I have the opportunity to design and construct my own fashion line. I currently work in both the digital fabrication lab and the woodshop within SOA, and have had professional work experience since my junior year of high school. I am seeking a full time position following my graduation this spring.</p>
