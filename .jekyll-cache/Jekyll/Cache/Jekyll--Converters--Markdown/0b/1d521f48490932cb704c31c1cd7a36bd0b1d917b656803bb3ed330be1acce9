I"}<p>My name is Alyssa Mayorga, I am a fourth-year in the Bachelor of Architecture degree at CMU.
I am from White Plains, New York and currently reside in Chesapeake, Virginia.  I am pursuing licensure with 300 AXP hours currently logged. My professional goal is to become a licensed architect and senior project manager in an established architecture or construction firm. I am driven to lead large groups in the development of the built environment. I would like to liaise between designers, contractors, and owners who make up the network that materializes construction projects while maintaining the essence of design initiatives.</p>
