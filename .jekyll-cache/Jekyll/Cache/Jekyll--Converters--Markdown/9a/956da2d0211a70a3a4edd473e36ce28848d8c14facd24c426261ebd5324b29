I"<p>My name is Leah Kendrick and I am a fifth-year architecture major, photography minor, and fashion designer at Carnegie Mellon University. I will be graduating in May of 2021 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree. I am passionate about architectural sustainability, environmental justice, and the effects of design engineering on ecological processes and the human condition. My enduring interest in photography and fashion design has driven me to study both practices outside of the studio. I strive to use these visual mediums as forms of self-expression and to further investigate architectural issues that I address in my work.</p>
