I"ÿ<p>I am a current fifth year thesis student in the Bachelor of Architecture program. A love of art, science, activism, and humanitarianism is what lead me to study architecture. Creating systematic change that protects the most vulnerable communities within our cities and towns is what really drives me, and there are countless ways to do this within the architecture field. My goal is to enact permanent change that creates an environment that emphasizes equity through empathy and the built environment.</p>
