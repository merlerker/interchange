I"H<p>As a fifth-year student at Carnegie Mellonâ€™s School of Architecture, I am eager to emerge in a professional environment. My time at SOA has kindled my passion for architecture and design fabrication by introducing me to the social, ecological, communal and historical aspects of the built environment. It has provided me opportunities to learn to communicate with clients and consultants, and has challenged me to consider how architecture can impact the future. A Minor in Design Fabrication has allowed me to strengthen my skill set in methods of analog and digital craft.</p>
