I"–<p>Hello, my name is Min Young Jeong and I am currently a fifth year student at CMU in the Bachelor of Architecture. I will be graduating this May with an additional minor in Architectural Design Fabrication. I am an enthusiastic architecture student who is willing to learn more about the industry and collaborate with others to make impacts and leave a legacy. My excitement not only lies in interior design and material studies, but also in digital fabrication, wood-working, and fashion and product design. As an architect, my goal is to create socially mindful and environmentally friendly space that will be sustainable and remembered for a long time.</p>
