I"‡<p>I am a current a fourth-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Architecture degree with minors in Physical Computing and Digital Fabrication. I view myself as a maker and am interested in the roles and interactions materiality can play in oneâ€™s life, as well as the process of fabrication and creating, with interests ranging from objects and environments to even fashion.  I aim to create works that re-instill beliefs and create memories of exploration, wonder and surprise within people (values we are slowly losing). I am looking for environments that similarly value aspects of creativity, collaboration across disciplines, and change.</p>
