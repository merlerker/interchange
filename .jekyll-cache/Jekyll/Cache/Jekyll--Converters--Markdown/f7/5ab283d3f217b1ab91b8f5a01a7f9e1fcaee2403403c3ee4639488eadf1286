I"u<p>I am a fifth-year B.Arch student with an Additional Major in Social and Political History. Growing up in a dense urban environment and completing multiple large-scale projects in my academic career has helped foster my fascination for architecture and its relationship with the urban fabric and ecological processes. I have continued the welcomed challenge of a design approach that considers architecture, urban design, and landscape architecture into my thesis work. I am seeking full-time employment to enhance my skill set, broaden my understanding of architecture and design, and gain experience to obtain licensure.</p>
