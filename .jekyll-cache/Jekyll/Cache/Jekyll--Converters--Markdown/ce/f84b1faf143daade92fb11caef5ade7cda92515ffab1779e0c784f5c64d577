I"<p>Hello, my name is Christine Kim and I am a third-year architecture student in the Carnegie Mellon University pursuing Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Architecture. I am 21 years old and from Oradell, New Jersey.
I took an interest in architecture through the architecture courses in my high school, American Heritage School in Plantation, Florida, and decided to pursue it as my major. Some of my hobbies are watching movies and cheerleading videos, and playing golf. I also like picking my 9-year-old brother up from school.</p>
