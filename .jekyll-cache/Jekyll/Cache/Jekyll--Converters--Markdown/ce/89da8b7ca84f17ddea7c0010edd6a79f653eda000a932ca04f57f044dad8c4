I"[<p>I am a third year Bachelors of Architecture student from Seattle, Washington. Through my love of the outdoors and of design, I have developed a great appreciation for sustainable and ecologically focused architecture and urbanism. I am looking forward to putting my detail oriented design methods into practice within an architecture firm.</p>
