I"ù<p>Louis Suarez is a 5th year student completing his Bachelor of Architecture and an Accelerated Master of Science in Sustainable Design. His interests cover a broad spectrum from sustainable design and materials science to architectural history and theory. These interests are reflected both in his speculative architectural work integrating cradle-to-cradle and circular economy design frameworks into vernacular building traditions, and in his professional work as a researcher for the Carnegie Mellon University Manufacturing Futures Initiative where he studies material waste streams to find new ways of reducing the carbon footprint in the building industry.</p>
