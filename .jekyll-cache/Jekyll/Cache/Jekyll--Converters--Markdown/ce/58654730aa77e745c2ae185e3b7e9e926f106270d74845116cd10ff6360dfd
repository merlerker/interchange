I"Å<p>Hello, I am Mariana Alberola-Rezza. I am a second year Master of Architecture student with two years of experience in architecture firms in Mexico City. Construction sites have made me reevaluate what being a Mexican architect represents: a chance to preserve the culture and traditions involved in my country‚Äôs vernacular architecture. I am interested in digital fabrication processes so that I can intersect the traditional crafts with new ways of implementing them. I cannot imagine my life without these particular elements of architecture, without being surrounded by textures, by the feeling and imagery of so many materials.</p>
