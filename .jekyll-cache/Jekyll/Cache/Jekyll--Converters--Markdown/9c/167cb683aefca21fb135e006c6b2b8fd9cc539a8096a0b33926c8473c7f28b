I"n<p>I am a 5th year Architecture and Chinese Studies double major student at Carnegie Mellon University. Born in Toronto, and raised in Paris, Korea, Toronto, and the United States, I have a huge interest in the world and how an architect with a wide spectrum of vision can begin to operate to reconnect the broken links. I believe architecture is a metaphoric translation and a narration of rational that is capable of arousing oneâ€™s sensation. As an intuitive designer with extensive knowledge and skills in design to achieve such aspiration, I am confident that I have a potential to offer in professional career.</p>
