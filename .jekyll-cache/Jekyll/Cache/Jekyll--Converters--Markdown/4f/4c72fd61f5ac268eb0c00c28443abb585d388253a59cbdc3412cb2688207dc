I"_<p>As a Masters of Architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University, innovative thinking is a direct reflection of my design work. Technology here, comes in as a supporting tool to my interests in the intersections of computation and building science - where I plan to specialize in my career. The symbiotic relationship of culture and ecological awareness is what enthuses me about the field of architecture. This sensitivity vigorously inspires me as a young designer, who seeks to enter the workforce and has faith in the power of the profession to ethically contribute to our shared environments.</p>
