I"Å<p>I am currently a fifth year student in the Bachelor of Architecture expecting to graduate this May with an additional minor in Intelligent Environments. My interests include sustainable design, urban design, community-based design, and public interest design. I want my work to thrive in an interdisciplinary environment that fosters creativity and to advocate for change through design work and thinking. On campus, I have been involved in Freedom By Design as a Director/member as well as cultural performances as a choreographer and actor. In my free time, I enjoy digital fabrication, origami, piano, cardistry, and martial arts.</p>
