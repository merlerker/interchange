I"Ì<p>I am currently a first year student in the CMU architecture program and am interested in finding an internship. Areas I am interested in include sustainability, new technologies that push what was previously unimaginable in the field, and contemporary architecture. Designing and building things has always been an interest of mine and is the main reason I am drawn to architecture as I can push my limits in design while also creating permanent works.</p>
