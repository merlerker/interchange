I"<p>​My name is Christine Zhu and I am in my third year of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University, anticipating a B.Arch in May 2020. Art was central to my life since age four, influencing my enjoyment towards handcraft, model making, and digital fabrication. Environmental science fascinates me and I hope to increase my knowledge on sustainable design and the path that architecture can take in mitigating arising problems. I hope to expand my view on the world through my interest in languages and one day traveling and working internationally. I was a perfectionist who learned to balance her perfectionism, and a detail oriented person who finds beauty in the smallest things. I am excited to broaden my architecture skills and experience in all possible directions.</p>
