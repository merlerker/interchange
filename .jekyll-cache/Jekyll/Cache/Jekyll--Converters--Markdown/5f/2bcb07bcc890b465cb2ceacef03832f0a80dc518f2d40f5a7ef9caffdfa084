I"c<p>My name is Romi! I am a fifth-year student pursuing a major in Architecture (B.Arch 2021) at CMU and a minor in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I was born in New York City, studied in Pittsburgh from 2016-2020, and currently reside in NYC again. I am interested in the potential of architecture to improve and discover solutions to worldwide issues (and ways of worldmaking), the integration of architecture with other fields, and the simple yet contradictory nature of architecture. My other curiosities include drawing, painting, designing, traveling, reading, photography, music, animals, and food.</p>
