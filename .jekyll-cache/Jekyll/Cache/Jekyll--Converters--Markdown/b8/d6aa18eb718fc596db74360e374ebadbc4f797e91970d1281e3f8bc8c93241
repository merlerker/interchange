I"<p>I am a fourth-year student from Queens, NY currently pursuing a five-year B.S. Architecture degree at Carnegie Mellon University. My architectural education is the framework through which I engage with discourse addressing the challenges of today. Outside of my architectural studies, my identity as a first generation Chinese-American has led me to pursue a minor in Chinese Studies, and my curiosity towards the intersection between human behavior, design, and technology has led me to pursue a minor in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
