I",<p>Hello my name is Gil Jang, I am a graduating B.Arch Student hoping to find a full time job. I am the editor in chief of an architecture journal: interÂ·punct. Although I love to write I prefer allow drawings and spaces to talk for themselves. I was born in Michigan but raised in South Korea.</p>
