I"<p>I am a 4th year student currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Architecture program at CMU. I have had 1 internship experience in Beijing, China in the summer of 2016 and spent the summer of 2017 working on a competition by YAC. My passion is to create rational but thoughtful architecture that changes and activates a place for everyone whether if they understand architecture or not. My passion for architecture began with such an experience when I was younger and I hope I can give that experience to others.</p>
