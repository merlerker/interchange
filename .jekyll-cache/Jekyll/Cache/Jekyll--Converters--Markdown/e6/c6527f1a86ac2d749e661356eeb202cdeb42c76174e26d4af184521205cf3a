I"P<p>Hello! My name is Ankitha Vasudev and I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Architecture. Since my summer internship at I.D.E.A Center Architects in India (2017), I have focused all my energy into my passion for architecture. I am interested in the relationships between space, form, program and human interaction and the need to design with the context and environment in mind. I am also passionate about projects that focus on community engagement. I am searching for internship opportunities to better my design skills and gain more experience in a professional setting.</p>
