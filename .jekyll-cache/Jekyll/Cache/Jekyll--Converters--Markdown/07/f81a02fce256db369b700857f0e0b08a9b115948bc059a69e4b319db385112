I"*<p>My name is Claire Xu. I’m a third-year B.Arch student pursuing a minor in Interdisciplinary Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. I have had numerous experiences with a diverse range of design fields including architecture, graphic, and UX/UI, which strengthened my belief and understanding of the interdisciplinary human-centered design approach. I have a strong design interest in the people and the sense of community, which I believe is a design topic that’s becoming more relevant under the influence of the pandemic.</p>
