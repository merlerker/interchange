I"<p>Iâ€™m currently a fourth year architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to attending Carnegie Mellon, I lived in Chicago where I completed my junior and senior year. Coming from San Francisco, I was immediately taken by the rich architectural heritage of Chicago. I am an avid soccer player, barber and street art lover. My current architectural interests are focused around design-build architecture, the role of sketching in architecture, and understanding the effects the built environment has on its community.</p>
