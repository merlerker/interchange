project: Connecting Communities Of Care In The Tenderloin
projtext: "Our work (Colleen Duong, Emmanuel Nwandu, and Doris Zhang) began with a close reading of past pandemics and concurrent systems of discrimination in San Francisco from the end of the 19th century through the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified the condition of the Tenderloin and the state of the housing insecure community as one that, among past pandemics, had been left to its own devices through local actors to cover institutional and infrastructural gaps. We then curated a care network that connects existing community actors and single room occupancies through small COVID-friendly mobile infrastructures and social group configurations to navigate the road through housing insecurity amid the pandemic. We researched community dynamics and the voices of the housing population to understand programming and response networks that would benefit them among what is already in the Tenderloin, and we will develop the kit of parts in line with two case study sites so we can better aid the networks of care informally put in place for the most vulnerable of this neighborhood.

I am a fifth year Bachelor of Architecture student seeking roles in architecture, interior design, and creative direction. My past experience includes creating beautiful spaces for single-family residences, and I look forward to pushing my realm of work into designing beautiful experiences through space, styling, and installation.
