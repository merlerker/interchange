project: Unearthed Agricultural Community Campus
projtext: "The UnEarthed campus is located on the southern tip of the mostly undeveloped, post-industrial site of Hazelwood Green in Pittsburgh, PA. Our client, Center of Life (COL), is an empowering and supportive community organization with the mission “to provide families and youth with the life skills, education, training, and resources necessary to be strong and to make their communities strong.” My team’s spatial and experiential vision was primarily rooted in satisfying COL’s mission and its persisting endeavor to supply people with food and cultural outlets for community members to express themselves through music and the arts.
The UnEarthed campus, with a focus on closed-loop cycles of food production, is a collaborative design effort that seeks to combine and provide to the community all of the resources and events that COL is known for. With the help of COL’s business and compliance manager, Neil Martin, my partner and I worked to create an open, flexible campus. Our program incorporated a greenhouse with an aquaponics system, three classrooms, and a food preparation room as well as campus intern housing and an adaptable community center used for a produce storefront, gallery space, farmer’s market, and more. Several professionals and experts generously offered their time to meet with the studio over the course of the semester to discuss feasible and affordable solutions for construction and sustainability. In addition to implementing these passive systems and strategies throughout the campus, my partner and I utilized shipping containers as a demountable, inexpensive base to allow for modularity and mobility if and
when the campus was to travel to a new site. We partnered with Hatponics and Sunward Steel who provided us with detailed drawings of their products. The series of spaces developed and fine-tuned throughout the semester not only foster urban agricultural growth but also provide food security and a sense of environmental agency to the community. This campus, situated at a crucial node in the Hazelwood neighborhood, offers diverse opportunities for its community members to thrive and hold a large and potentially expandable space on Hazelwood Green; this is a stretch of land that is primarily planned to be a hub for collegiate research rather than one of support for its surrounding, under-served community. The fight for climate justice and environmental intersectionality stands at the forefront with other social issues that we find ourselves confronted with when creating and thinking about architecture. This project acts as a catalyst for future developments that focus on community growth and sustainable practices that benefit a neighborhood, city, and beyond."

My name is Leah Kendrick and I am a fifth-year architecture major, photography minor, and fashion designer at Carnegie Mellon University. I will be graduating in May of 2021 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree. I am passionate about architectural sustainability, environmental justice, and the effects of design engineering on ecological processes and the human condition. My enduring interest in photography and fashion design has driven me to study both practices outside of the studio. I strive to use these visual mediums as forms of self-expression and to further investigate architectural issues that I address in my work.
