project: "Get Out of Your Comfort Zone"
projtext: "As global warming accelerates, buildings currently account for 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions annually. Despite this fact, architecture is increasingly designed as hermetically sealed boxes, requiring increased conditioning, which in turn further contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions warming up our planet. Technology has evolved so much so that we have disassociated ourselves with the natural environment, and isolated our spaces away from weather patterns. In my thesis, I challenge this conventional approach to architectural design through the idea of ‘program externalization’, examining which programs could be partially or fully open to the outdoor environment as a method to minimize reliance on mechanical conditioning."

Hello! I am a 5th year Bachelor of Architecture Undergraduate and 1st year Master of Science in Sustainable Design student at CMU. Growing up in 3 different countries that varied greatly from one another, I came to recognize and appreciate the role of nature in our built environment and our social fabric. Through my pursuit of sustainability in architectural practice, I have developed passion for social resilience, circular economy, systems thinking, ecological design, and computational simulations in architectural practice. I strive to integrate these different aspects into my work to produce a positive impact environmentally and socially.
