project: Humanizing Brutalism 
projtext: "Located within London, the Southbank Centre is home to Europe’s largest centre for arts. The existence of the Royal Festival Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall, and the Hayward Gallery stands as a symbol for London’s art, architecture, and skateboarding. From the spotlights of the dazzling performance chambers to the lively under-croft skate park, the brutalist Southbank Centre is a home for those who seek art.

This studio, Humanizing Brutalism, aims to introduce a flexible performance chamber within Southbank Centre as a means to portray brutalism in a new manner. Design challenges of this project includes the 500-seat chamber and master planning of the Southbank Centre."

Hi, my name is Curran Zhang. I am a current 5th year B.Arch. student. Born and raised in NYC, I am very interested in large scale projects and urban design. Upon graduation, I hope to find a full time job that would allow me to purse such interests.
