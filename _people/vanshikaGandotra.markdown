I'm currently a third year pursuing a B.Arch. in the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University along with a business minor. I am a member of CMU NOMAS and the executive board of Fresh Check Day, the biggest mental health awareness organization on campus. I am passionate about design as art driven by necessity and the impact that buildings have on shaping the identity of cities and in turn, the lives of people. I also enjoy exploring representational and fabrication techniques.
