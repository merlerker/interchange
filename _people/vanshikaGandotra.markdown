project: "Flutter"
projtext: "The design is inspired by the metaphor of a butterfly in flight as a formal concept manifested through sculptural and structural wing-shaped post-tensioned heavy timber beams. The primary goal is using nature to uplift the experience of air travel. A butterfly conservatory has been introduced at the node as an additional programmatic element meant to be experienced by departing and arriving passengers of all ages. Additionally, the airport concourse aims to incorporate nature by landscaping the length of the main concourse using green walls and additional planters. The organic form of the amenity spaces in plan correlates to central garden in the JFK Redevelopment Plan."

Iâ€™m currently a fourth-year pursuing a B.Arch. in the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University. I am passionate about design as art driven by necessity and the impact that buildings have on shaping the identity of cities and in turn, the lives of people. I am very interested in Cultural, Public and large-scale architecture. I have an interest in innovative structural design and thoroughly enjoy learning about building systems. Outside of academics, I devote my time to Fresh Check Day, Peer Health Advocates and CMU NOMAS.
