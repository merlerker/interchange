The proposed design is a mobile coastal waste collector and purifier. It is a buoyant structure designed to mitigate the effects of NYC’s trash and CSO problems.  In a man-made world threatened by overwhelming amounts of waste, this design draws inspiration from one of nature’s finest coastal water and air purifiers, the Water Lily. Just as the waterlily’s roots are anchored to the ground while it floats and gathers nutrients, our design proposal collects waste from around Manhattan that is then processed to generate power and other byproducts."
