project: "Urban Acupuncture For Community Forge"
projtext: "For the spring of 2019, I was part of the The Urban Collaboratory Studio, which combines design tactics with strategies for place-making in the bottom-up transformation of cities.
 
I was one of the Pattern Island project managers, specifically, I was in charge of developing design concepts, figuring out logistical aspects of procurement and how to take an idea from concept to reality, and, also, preparing all design and construction drawings. 

Rather than responding to a predefined design brief, we worked with Community Forge and the Wilkinsburg community members on defining ideas and opportunities for the schoolyard of the former Johnston Elementary School, turned community center.  The studio works collaboratively, challenging the notion of singular authorship by including Community Forge tenants, users, neighbors, kids and other stakeholders as co-designers."

I am a fifth year B.Arch student with minors in Intelligent Environments and Physical Computing. This unique mixture of education has given me the ability to take projects from ideation, to actualization, to post-actualization analysis. I want to dedicate my life to positive social impact, whether through design, built structures, art or providing a necessary service to fulfill that. Being from Kuwait, I am very passionate about working with refugees and displaced people, and fighting for womenâ€™s rights and women empowerment.
