My background was in Civil Engineering and I have gained the skills about structural design and could operate relating structural analyze and BIM software.
I am learning the Real Estate Design Course, and will attend the Real Estate Seminar this semester. In my current real estate design team project, I am in charge of doing marketing research about demographics of the neighborhood and analyse competitors of the development project. Prompted by the passion of learning new skills, I also have experience in Python and Database Management.
