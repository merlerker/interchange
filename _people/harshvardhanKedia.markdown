I'm a senior in Architecture looking for full-time work where I can use my interdisciplinary skillset to tackle real-world problems and use design to add value to peopleâ€™s everyday lives. My expertise lies between architecture and computation and I'm an avid tinkerer, writer and hacker. I enjoy breaking, making and expressing myself through technology - be it an arduino, a javascript program, or an industrial robotic arm.
