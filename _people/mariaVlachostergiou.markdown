Maria Vlachostergiou is an Architect Engineer (NTUA’16), Design Researcher (NTUA ’19) and Computational Designer (CMU ’21). Her 'research by design' activity addresses technical, evocative and expressive aspects in assistive technologies so that a disabled body recovers holistically; physically, emotionally and socially.
Combining skills such as programming, assistive design by physical computing, interaction and accessibility design, modelling and fabrication of programmable materials and soft robots, Maria collaborates with disabled people to design and prototype Human-Computer or Human-Robot Interactions that have the potential to become symbols for both the users and their community.
