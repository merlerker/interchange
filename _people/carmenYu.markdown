projtext: "“Theater is meant to be a communal experience.. You don’t know anyone next to you or around you, but you’re captivated by the same thing” - Karen Federing (CMU School of Drama Faculty)

South Bank Centre is a cultural hub largely shared by its surrounding community, encompassing the theater community (talent, crew and patrons), skater community (that lives under the Queen Elizabeth Hall), as well as tourists and locals. The new overall site organization partially removes the existing elevated walkways to allow for all major lobby entrances to be located on the ground floor. Having all the entrances on the same ground plane, rather than being dispersed by different elevations, unifies the shared public spaces within the South Bank Centre, while bringing the community together."

My name is Carmen Yu. I am currently a fifth year pursuing a Bachelors of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University (Class of 2021). Along with architecture, I have strong interests in urban design and fabrication. I am also participating in this year's Lunar Gala in which I have the opportunity to design and construct my own fashion line. I currently work in both the digital fabrication lab and the woodshop within SOA, and have had professional work experience since my junior year of high school. I am seeking a full time position following my graduation this spring.
