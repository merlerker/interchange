I am currently a first-year graduate student in the MS in Sustainable Design at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a diverse academic background (French+MSSD) and a rigorous 2+years of work experience in interior design that allows me to grasp different architectural domains of knowledge and to consider things in a more professional and pragmatic manner. I am now looking for a Summer internship in the green building sector that aims to build synergies between building technology, interior design, and energy analysis to optimize building performance using multi-disciplinary solutions. I am looking forward to joining the green building industry through this internship.
