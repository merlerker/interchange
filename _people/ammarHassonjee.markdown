Hi, my name is Ammar Hassonjee and I'm currently a third year architecture student at Carnegie Mellon. I'm also pursuing an additional minor in Intelligent Environments from the IDeATe department at CMU. My primary interest in architecture is exploring how the design process and build process can be integrated into one workflow by utilizing up and coming digital fabrication technologies and computational design. I've had previous experience working for a design build firm in Mumbai, India, and doing construction document work for an architecture firm in Princeton, New Jersey.
