As a fifth-year student at Carnegie Mellon University currently pursuing Bachelor of Architecture with a minor in Animation and Special Effects, I believe my education prepared me for my skill qualifications in this field. Being a LEED Green Associate affiliated to U.S. Green Building Council, I have a general knowledge of green building practices and am capable to support others working on LEED projects. Also, with three internships in architecture offices and one in a culture media company in the past four summers, my rich experience would bring diversity into companies.
