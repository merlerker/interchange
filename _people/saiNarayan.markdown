I am an architect and urban designer working between design, planning, and community development, graduating in May 2019. I completed my Bachelors in Architecture from Syracuse University in 2015, and have worked as an architect and researcher in Mumbai for 2 years. While in Mumbai, I collaborated on various residential, mixed-use and low-cost township projects, focusing on the design development and client presentation stages.
Most recently, I spent the past year researching suspended and discontinued postal facilities in the Pittsburgh region so that they may be adapted into hubs for community resilience, and am pursuing my thesis which focuses on bottom up strategies to promote water advocacy through public spaces in the city of Pittsburgh.
