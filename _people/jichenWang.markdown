project: "Self-sufficient Community"
projtext: "According to historical research on waste disposal system in the world, it is found that the spatial boundary between social classes has gradually disappeared. However, that is not the case in big cities in India. Considering the distinct spatial boundaries between the rich and
the poor in India, this project mainly combines the India's traditional textile industry with the waste disposal system to form a recycling community. This community intends to provide work opportunities for the poor, promote consumption by the rich and weaken the spatial
and psychological boundaries between the rich and the poor."
