project: "Self-sufficient Community"
projtext: "According to historical research on waste disposal system in the world, it is found that the spatial boundary between social classes has gradually disappeared. However, that is not the case in India. Considering the obvious spatial boundaries between the rich and the poor in India, the design mainly combines the India's characteristic textile industry with the waste treatment system to form a recycling community. The community provides work opportunities for the poor, promotes consumption by the rich, and weakens the spatial and psychological boundaries between the rich and the poor."

From 2013 to 2018, I gained my B.Arch degree in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In 2018, I won the excellent graduate design, which is the first place, in my school. During my internship in Playze Shanghai in 2017, I collaborated well with the team. My ability of drawing, modeling,  critical thinking and communication helped me to earn the reliance of my colleagues and gives me chances to contact with various projects and process. In CMU, I gained knowledge on more current technology like robotics and learned coding for better manipulation of the tools.
