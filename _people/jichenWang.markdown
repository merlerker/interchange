From 2013 to 2018, I gained my B.Arch degree in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In 2018, I won the excellent graduate design, which is the first place, in my school. During my internship in Playze Shanghai in 2017, I collaborated well with the team. My ability of drawing, modeling,  critical thinking and communication helped me to earn the reliance of my colleagues and gives me chances to contact with various projects and process. In CMU, I gained knowledge on more current technology like robotics and learned coding for better manipulation of the tools.
