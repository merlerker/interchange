projtext: "This project was to design a small office space for a 50 person startup company, that has open spaces for the community. East Liberty is a neighborhood transitioning through a gentrification period; the connection to the neighborhood is especially important in allowing the old neighborhood transition into the new. I have also included a set of technical drawings and a code review I have completed for this project."

I am a third year Architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University. I was raised in a Latino household in Burlington, Ontario. Since the summer I spent at Cornell University (2015), I have focused all of my energy into my passion for Architecture. I am fascinated by how people interact with their surroundings, the relationship between interior and exterior space, as well as the way we design with the environment in mind. I am fully immersed in my Architectural Education, so I have chosen to spend my summers enriching my education and look forward to more summer experiences and internships.
