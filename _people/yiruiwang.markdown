Veronica is a fifth year B. Arch candidate with a minor in Design, looking for a full-time job in New York. She has great interests in architectural design, urban planning and communications design. She is currently taking the Masters of Urban Design II studio and working on a thesis project that investigates the shared urban spaces between humans and synanthropic species, and the possibilities of pooling resources to create a commoning environment incorporated with the iconic public stairs infrastructure in Pittsburgh. Last year her studio work had been exhibited in the Heinz Architectural Center at Carnegie Museum of Art. This coming June, in collaboration with her studio colleagues and led by Professor Gruber, some of her work will be featured in the traveling exhibition, An Atlas of Commoning, by ARCH+ magazine and ifa (Institut f√ºr Auslandsbeziehungen) at the Miller ICA.
