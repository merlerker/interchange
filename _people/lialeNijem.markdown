Coming from the Middle East, where women are challenged to be independent and pursue their dreams, I decided to break the mold and become what I want to be. I am currently a second year MArch student, who is learning new things everyday.

I am an outgoing, social and a hardworking person and at my happiest when given a task and take much pride upon its fulfillment. I thrive on challenges and new adventures. Experiences help me to grow as a person and challenges me to push the boundaries of my comfort zone.
