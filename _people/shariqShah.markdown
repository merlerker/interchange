Hello, I’m Shariq.

I am a first generation Pakistani-American 
aspiring architect, researcher, and systems thinker 
in my 4th year of my Bachelor of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University.

I’ve always been excited by the ability of design to craft meaningful human-centered experiences, focusing my design questions around enhancing multisensory and dynamic environments. My work explores research-centered approaches to ecological, social, and economic systems and leverages experimentation, research, and rapid iteration in order to investigate critical questions and solve problems. 

When I’m not in the studio, you can find me on Spotify crafting the perfect playlist, listening to 99% Invisible, running, hiking, or biking!

I am a music, art, and language enthusiast, and I am always open to having quality conversations over a good cup of coffee. If you’re open to a conversation, I would love to connect!
