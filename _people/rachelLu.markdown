project: Silo Nyc
projtext: "SILO NYC highlights urban farming through a cooperative residential
community in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. It re-envisions the
essential food supply systems that once existed there and introduces
wastewater and organic waste treatment systems to create a closed
loop system, using waste as a resource. The project intends to increase
awareness of a waste-free lifestyle, as well as making available more
healthy and sustainable alternatives of food to people in the city.

The design features closed loop system where food is grown on site, or
sourced locally and transported by water, to be used for cooking and
selling. All organic waste would be composted in an anaerobic digester and put back into the growing cycle.

On site would include a housing co-op, a community that encourages
and supports each other towards the goal of living a zero-waste lifestyle.
It would create a community for elder immigrants that may have been
farmers in the past, who now have no jobs, and enjoy gardening and
would like company, mixed with younger adults who are willing to learn,
such as college students. Each units would be responsible for growing
fruits and vegetables, with a greenhouse attached, and the community
will pool resources when harvested to share."

Hi! My name is Rachel Lu, and I am a graduating 5th year B.Arch student. I was born and raised in New York City, so I have a strong interest in designing in urban cities, spending most of my last two years on housing design in the cities of Pittsburgh, New York City, and Porto. I am also interested in architectural publication and curation. This past year, I produced the EX-CHANGE publication for the School of Architecture, and I am on the editorial board of interâ€¢punct, a student journal for architecture.
