I'm a first year M.Arch student in CMU. I'm interested in the urban impacts of architecture and how technologies serve as a powerful intervension of design process. The aesthetic value of architecture is never my top focus in design. And  I'm more interested the logic behind design. As a person, I'm creative and highly-organized.
