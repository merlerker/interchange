project: Carrick Environmental Learning Center
projtext: "The Phillips Park Environmental Learning Center aims to allow nature to take center stage by situating the building below grade and blurring the boundary between indoor and outdoor. This big site move and material choices help transition the building as a solid mass into light columns and glass. The building uses an elliptical form as a driver of circulation and opens up to the South for different views and qualities of sunlight."

Shanice is a 4th year Bachelor of Architecture student and instructor for the Center of Architecture Explorations. An architect and designer, Shanice is exploring ways to tie her love for design, cities, plants, and people.

In the fall of 2020, Shanice worked on a sustainable campus in Hazelwood Green for urban farming and education, with a net-zero passive greenhouse as the major focus. Her work focused on modularity and demonstrability of parts, reducing energy use, and testing passive building strategies with computer simulations.

In the future, Shanice hopes to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree related to Landscape Architecture or Graphic Design.
