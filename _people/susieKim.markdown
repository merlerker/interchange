project: "Eco-Morphology: Living Bridge"
projtext: "Considering projections of rising waters, extreme weather and aging infrastructures, the site of the Six Mile Island became a testing ground for new hybrid bridge infrastructures. By examining the relationships between human and animal movements while identifying micro-climatic river behaviors, a living ecological corridor bridge targeted at becoming a multifaceted solution was created. The bridge uses a node and line system commonly seen in ecological corridors to provide species diversity and population stabilization to animals, while also acting as a food garden and water restoration intervention through algae systems. Above all, the bridge functions as an intertwined, living and breathing system that connects human and animal movement."

Hello! My name is Susie, and I am currently a rising third year architecture student pursuing my Bachelor of Architecture degree at Carnegie Mellon University with a double minor in Human Computer Interaction and Business Administration. As a student at CMU, I have discovered my passion for collaborating with diverse individuals and solving hybrid design problems, and believe that my past leadership and work experiences would make me a great fit to work as an Intern. I hope we have the opportunity to connect about my interests and qualifications soon!
