goal: Internship
project: Spring Garden Hostel
projtext: "This project revolves around adaptive re-use by building a youth hostel within/around an existing building shell. The site is a vacant lot (excluding the existing brick shell) in the Spring Garden neighborhood of Pittsburgh.
The youth hostel is to serve as a means of urban regeneration by providing gathering and interaction spaces for the hostel dwellers and the  general public. To achieve this the first floor was made completely public, while the upper floors also challenge ideas regarding public vs. private spaces for the hostel dwellers. The coil-like form of the hostel was derived from the creation of a central (primary) courtyard and the ability for interior and exterior activities to interact. The south fa√ßade of the shell was removed in order to create a diagonal form that faces the front plaza and serves as the hostel entrance."

Hello! My name is Ankitha Vasudev and I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Architecture. Since my summer internship at I.D.E.A Center Architects in India (2017), I have focused all my energy into my passion for architecture. I am interested in the relationships between space, form, program and human interaction and the need to design with the context and environment in mind. I am also passionate about projects that focus on community engagement. I am searching for internship opportunities to better my design skills and gain more experience in a professional setting.
