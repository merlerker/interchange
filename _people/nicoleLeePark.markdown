projtext: "The major concern mediates between the urbanism of large, infrastructures and the freedom of the individual through the idea of genetic architecture that is capable of regeneration of cells and adaptable configuration of dwellings, which can expand and shrink according to need.”

 In supporting the world’s unprecedented population growth, water has become crucial in determining the future of our growth. Water consumption behavior, in correspondence to such social phenomenon, is projected to escalate by 55 percent by the year 2050, and by 2100, global warming, increasing in sea levels and lack of land resources, is envisaged to prompt a shift of inhabitation to the waterfront. It has become a necessity to provide a network of water settlement that is not tied to land ownership, territory rights, but rather to promote the sharing movement of collectivity for new social agenda and environmental engagement. In stating these issues, eco-morphology project proposes an opportunity to rethink the housing project as we return to the notion of commons and the collective."

I am a 5th year Architecture and Chinese Studies double major student at Carnegie Mellon University. Born in Toronto, and raised in Paris, Korea, Toronto, and the United States, I have a huge interest in the world and how an architect with a wide spectrum of vision can begin to operate to reconnect the broken links. I believe architecture is a metaphoric translation and a narration of rational that is capable of arousing one’s sensation. As an intuitive designer with extensive knowledge and skills in design to achieve such aspiration, I am confident that I have a potential to offer in professional career.
