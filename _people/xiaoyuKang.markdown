I am currently a 3rd student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a major in architecture and a minor in business administration. I currently live in Boston. 

I have traveled to over 20 countries. The experiences I had while traveling helped me resonate with the cultures from around the world, and understand how architecture plays a role in the lives of people from different environmental, social, and economical backgrounds. I am intrigued by how architecture and urban design can shape an individualâ€™s relationship with a city. I am also passionate about using architecture as a medium to solve problems.
