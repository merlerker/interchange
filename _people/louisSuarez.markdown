project: The Pennsylvania Chicken House (La Maison Poulet)
projtext: "The Pennsylvania Chicken House is an experimental home designed in collaboration between senior architecture students Longney Luk and Louis Suarez. Based on the traditional Pennsylvania bank-barn, the PA Chicken House is built on a sloped site with the entrance at the top. The bottom level is an open-air grotto with built-in shelter for the residents chickens or other fowl. The PA Chicken House is pre-fabricated from recycled concrete and formed with 3D-printing technology. The components are digitally designed with the aid of shape optimization algorithms to decrease the mass while still maintaining structural performance. The pieces are then fabricated, transported, and assembled on-site. The complex forms due to the shape optimization also serve to create microcosms for the chickens and garden plants inhabit. The upper two levels comprise the house's main living space and loft, respectively. The main level consists of a flexible open-floorplan with spaces for kitchen, dining, and leisure. A central hearth is specially designed to radiantly heat the space, including the bath located behind the chimney. The upper loft includes two bed rooms, a family chapel, and a small lounge."

Louis Suarez is a 5th year student completing his Bachelor of Architecture and an Accelerated Master of Science in Sustainable Design. His interests cover a broad spectrum from sustainable design and materials science to architectural history and theory. These interests are reflected both in his speculative architectural work integrating cradle-to-cradle and circular economy design frameworks into vernacular building traditions, and in his professional work as a researcher for the Carnegie Mellon University Manufacturing Futures Initiative where he studies material waste streams to find new ways of reducing the carbon footprint in the building industry.
