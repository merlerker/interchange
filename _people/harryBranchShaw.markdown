project: Environmental Charter School
projtext: "The Environmental Charter School is located in the Point Breeze neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA. However, the school is looking to open a new location due to the popular demand for admission. A proposed site is in Central Lawrenceville, adjacent to the Carnegie Mellon University National Robotics Engineering Center and the Allegheny River. This location is ideal as the school model encourages learning through exposure to the outdoor environment. The site on the river offers access to open green space and the riverbank, allowing students space to learn and play. 

My design encompasses ideas of psychogeography, the notion that one can wander playfully in urban environments. The goal is to design a school that employs a unique circulatory experience throughout the building to create new moments of interaction and collaboration for the students. A central ramp system supports study spaces, reading nooks, a library, and a hallway. The class grades are separated by floor but the ramps offer interaction between students of different ages. I want to generate an experience that encourages an occupant to proceed through the building to find out what comes next.

This studio was particularly focused on construction and materiality. I chose to employ an arch-based glulam structure to create a vaulted envelope that encloses the ramp, classrooms, and school support spaces. Exposed timber construction helps cultivate feelings of natural surroundings in an enclosed space. My material palette relies on natural materials that are sourced in close proximity to the site. The façade is recycled roof slate, which is in abundance in Pittsburgh.

As a fifth-year student at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Architecture, I am eager to emerge in a professional environment. My time at SOA has kindled my passion for architecture and design fabrication by introducing me to the social, ecological, communal and historical aspects of the built environment. It has provided me opportunities to learn to communicate with clients and consultants, and has challenged me to consider how architecture can impact the future. A Minor in Design Fabrication has allowed me to strengthen my skill set in methods of analog and digital craft.
