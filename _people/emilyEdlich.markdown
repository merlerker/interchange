I am a fourth-year Bachelor of Architecture undergraduate at CMU, also pursuing a minor in German Studies. I am passionate about developing innovative, context-based solutions in communities facing environmental and social challenges. I hope to use my architectural skills to progress toward a more sustainable future for our communities. I am searching for an internship in PA to contribute to local projects as well as gain experience toward licensure.
