project: Covillage
projtext: "CoVillage is the 2021 ULI Hines Competition project I participated as a team lead.
CoVillage is proposed based on three design principles: connection, co-existence and co-creativeness. This transformational mixed-use development contains a well-structured transit system that connects with the surrounding neighborhoods. With the creation of the various housing types and amenities, villagers are able to embrace healthy and even lifestyles in this inclusive place. Creative industries are combined in a unique way with sustainability, focusing on recycling waste and beautifying the landscape.
Through developing the connection, co-existence and co-creativeness of a new community, the project can support CoVillage to grow and flourish to a smart, livable, and sustainable future."

Currently a second year Master of Urban Design student in CMU SoA. After receiving 5-year urban and architecture design education as a professional urban planner in undergraduate period, I keep pursuing urban design degree in CMU. Currently my projects and research mostly focus on sustainable city and community development and urban commons studies. I am interested in exploring emerging technologies and methodologies as interventions into citiesâ€™ development. As an urban designer, I am innovative and highly-organized both in teams and individually.
