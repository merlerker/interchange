I am currently a first year Master of Urban Design student in CMU SoA. After receiving 5-year urban and architecture design education as a professional urban planner in my undergraduate period, I keep pursuing urban design in CMU. In my graduate period, I mostly focus on community design and urban system research by using multidisciplinary skills including software analysis, interactive design, rendering and modeling. I am interested in emerging technologies' influences on cities' development in different scales. As an urban design, I am innovative and highly-organized.
