I am Suprima Joshi, first year graduate student studying masterâ€™s in urban design at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a background in architecture, however, I have always been interested in place making and interreacting with community for its urban development.  I was involved with riverfront improvement project in Nepal in which I got to sharpen my interest furthermore.
