I am a 2nd year M. Arch student, currently working on my thesis of redevelopment sans displacement of slums in Indian megacities. I have interned with EvolveEA in Pittsburgh over the past summer under Marc and Christine Mondor, who do innovative and interesting urban design work focusing on long term sustainability. I am looking for a full time job opportunity at a firm that has a focus aligned with my interests of urban design and sustainability wherein I can research and work towards a better, sustainable future. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinjoy-hazra-1993cmu2020/">LinkedIn Profile</a>;
