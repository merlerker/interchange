I"ê<p>I am a graduating senior in the BA in Architecture program with a Minor in Computer Science. After graduation, I plan to enter into CMU‚Äôs MS in Computational Design program with advanced standing - graduating in December 2019.
The integration of advanced computational techniques into architectural decision making is incredibly exciting to me, and is something I spend a great deal of time thinking about. I am primarily interested in leveraging computation to extend the analytic abilities and productivity of architects and real estate developers. If this sounds interesting to you, let‚Äôs get in touch ‚Äì I‚Äôm always up for a conversation!</p>
