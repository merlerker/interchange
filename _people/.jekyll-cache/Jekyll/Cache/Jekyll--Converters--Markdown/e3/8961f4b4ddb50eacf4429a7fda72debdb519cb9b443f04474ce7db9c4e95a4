I"^<p>I am a third year Architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University. I was raised in a Latino household in Burlington, Ontario. Since the summer I spent at Cornell University (2015), I have focused all of my energy into my passion for Architecture. I am fascinated by how people interact with their surroundings, the relationship between interior and exterior space, as well as the way we design with the environment in mind. I am fully immersed in my Architectural Education, so I have chosen to spend my summers enriching my education and look forward to more summer experiences and internships.</p>
