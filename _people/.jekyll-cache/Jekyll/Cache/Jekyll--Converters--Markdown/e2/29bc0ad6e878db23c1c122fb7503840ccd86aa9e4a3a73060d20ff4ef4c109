I"Â<p>My name is Jonathan Cheng. I am a third-year architecture student at The School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University. I was raised in New York City, whose skyline has influenced my career in architecture. Before pursing architecture, I worked in medical science and research. The problem-solving component of research has carried over into my work in architecture; which is to me, an anthropological problem with a systematic design.</p>
