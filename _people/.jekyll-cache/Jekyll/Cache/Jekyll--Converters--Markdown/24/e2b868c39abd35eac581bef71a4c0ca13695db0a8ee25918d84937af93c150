I"Y<p>I am an architect, currently enrolled as a first year student in the Master of Science in Building Performance and Diagnostics (MS-BPD) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am driven by my passion to create high quality, productive environments which incorporate sustainability in every aspect of the building delivery process and life cycle. My primary focus is the energy effectiveness of buildings in conjunction with occupant comfort and satisfaction. I hope to contribute to the building industry as well as the society and environment by applying my passion and learning in practice.</p>
