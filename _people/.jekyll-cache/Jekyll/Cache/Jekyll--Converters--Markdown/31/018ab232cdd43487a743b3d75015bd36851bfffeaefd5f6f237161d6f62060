I"§<p>In my recent years of architectural studies &amp; practice, I have been focused to explore and understand various factors that would improve the quality of spaces in my design. Developing sustainable spaces that are a blend of creative and practical approaches, through the sound knowledge of advanced computer aided design applications, motivates me to be a radical thinker who is also proactive at work. Interested in joining and developing my skills as an architectural intern in a fast paced &amp; progressive design firm. Currently in the first year and second semester of the Master of Science in Sustainable Design program and expected graduation in December 2019.</p>
