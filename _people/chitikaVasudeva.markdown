My education at Carnegie Mellon has helped me strengthen my love for history, fascination with the ever-changing nature of cities, and passion for sustainability. This is evident in my fifth-year thesis, which proposes a set of community-oriented uses for disused Pittsburgh Public School buildings. Driven by a firm belief that architecture is one of the most effective tools to achieve social and environmental justice, I am seeking full-time employment with the intent of pursuing my architectural license and furthering my own skills and abilities to make the world a more equitable and responsible place.
