project: Living Bridge At Sixmile Island
projtext: "
Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania is a small community on the Allegheny River. Hemmed in on one side by Highway 28 and steep topography to the north, and cut off from river access by rail lines and industrial ruins, the community suffers from economic inequality and poor health outcomes. In this studio, I explored methods of re-connection between Sharpsburg, its waterfront, and the public land of Sixmile Island that respect all actors within the urban ecosystem, both human and nonhuman.

In Sharpsburg, the flow of wind and water are just as essential as the movement of traffic and people within the urban system. Just as a wind turbine orients itself to the wind in order to draw power, an architecture can do the same, filtering wind and water. In responding to the movement of the water below and the micro-climatic conditions of the wind passing above, the bridge can become an extension of the topography which naturally filters out pollutants. In this way, the bridge can become a place to experience the theatre of nature as well formal and informal performance of humans and non-human actors."

I am a third year Bachelors of Architecture student from Seattle, Washington. Through my love of the outdoors and of design, I have developed a great appreciation for sustainable and ecologically focused architecture and urbanism. I am looking forward to putting my detail oriented design methods into practice within an architecture firm.
