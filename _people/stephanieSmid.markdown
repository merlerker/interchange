Hello! I am Stephanie, a second year Masters of Advanced Architectural Design student. After graduating with a BS in Architecture from the University of Virginia, I worked in traditional design firms before returning for my Masters. I'm passionate about digital fabrication and material experimentation. I hope to pursue a career that allows me to work at the intersections of design and technology.
