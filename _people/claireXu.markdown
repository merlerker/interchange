project: Tree House Module
projtext: "With the intention of promoting experiences immersed in the quintessence of rural France landscape, the tree house modules are designed to pay homage to the majestically gothic spires and bring its ruins back to life. The modules provide refuge for visitors and strive to find an experiential balance between human and nature. 

The core of the module holds a pure geometrical form, providing essential living conditions for humans. The external frame is inspired by the entanglement of vegetation on site, and is constructed for the purpose of interaction and experience of visitors. Steel columns suspend Both modules are suspended above ground, aiming to leave minimal footprint on the existing landscape. Modules are structurally self supporting, thus allowing the module to develop a close and respectful relationship with the surrounding environment. The module is intended to be placed on the d’artagnan properties in an formally and physically unobtrusive way, while providing opportunities for human and nature to establish close connections with each other.

Duration: 3 weeks
Collaborators: Xiaoyu Kang, Xuyang Wu, Weiran Jia"

My name is Claire Xu. I'm a third-year B.Arch student pursuing a minor in Interdisciplinary Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. I have had numerous experiences with a diverse range of design fields including architecture, graphic, and UX/UI, which strengthened my belief and understanding of the interdisciplinary human-centered design approach. I have a strong design interest in the people and the sense of community, which I believe is a design topic that’s becoming more relevant under the influence of the pandemic.
