I enjoy contributing to projects which are contextually driven and have a social, political as well as an economical impact on the built environment. I take keen interest in working with the challenges that arise in the everyday practice along every stage of the project. Working in collaborative environments that engage with different professions has always excited me. I appreciate the quality of architectural practice which allows one to engage at different scales - to deal with intangible social and urban issues and at the same time allow one to dive into details to resolve each nut and bolt of a project. This attracted me to Carnegie Mellon University where I got the opportunity to work with Prof. John Folan, Urban Design Build Studio and Prof. Stefan Gruber on various projects that have helped me enhance my skills sets as an architect, urbanist and a social thinker.
