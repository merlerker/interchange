Hello! My name is Eesha Nagpal and I am a freshman in the B.Arch program at CMU with a strong interest in the societal and environmental impacts that architecture and design can have. I am driven towards architecture as I love the way one can leave a lasting impact on people's lives through the intimate connection one makes while creating their living space or a space that will help them live better lives. With this attitude and a desire to learn something new every day, I hope to be an asset to your practice.
