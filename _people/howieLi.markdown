I was born in Phoenix Arizona and grew up in in San Diego California. I am currently enrolled in the B.Arch program at Carnegie Mellon University (Class of 2023+). Having grown up with a wide range passions, integrating various fields of thinking is deeply engrained in who I am. I strive to pursue architecture as a means of implementing my various passions in the pursuit of of art, as well as advance the field in order to meet the agile evolution of our society and culture.
