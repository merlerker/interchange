project: Uni - Institutional Building 
projtext: "Located amidst the hills in the rural area of Hulkoti, India, is an engineering college which was undergoing renovation. The owner, our client, needed a new Cultural Center to be designed, for the students and locals.  The site was a 10,000 sqft space on the campus and the proposed structure would be the first thing that the people would see while entering the campus. Hence, the client yearned for an Iconic Structure to jump-start the renovation. The client had a requirement of integrating three distinct functions into the structure viz., an OAT, a gym and a cafeteria. First a tri-pyramidal structural was proposed, conceptualizing a ‘Uni-Body’ design (where the distinct programs could exist in harmony, under one-single-roof), which was later transformed into a more organic form, to enhance the aesthetics.  The building form was optimized for solar radiation, visual comfort/glare analyses, flow simulation (for rain-water harvesting), CFD (passive wind-flow), views and for penalization (fabrication for the outer double-curved ferro-concrete-shell structure). The project can be view via Google Maps' satellite imagery through the following links:
