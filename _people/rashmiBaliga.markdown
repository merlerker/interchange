project: "Architecture for Outreach"
projtext: "The project was aimed at improving healthcare accessibility in rural India by the means of an outreach system. The system utilized portable, deployable architectural modules which were housed in a mobile clinic, which was in turn serviced by a rural health center. 
My strategic approach involved a study of the local infrastructure and roadways, vernacular architecture, and power and waste management systems in a village with an existing health center. The ultimate aim of the project was to create a new rural health center with enhanced capabilities, retrofit the existing center to act as a community development tool, and use a combination of the two buildings to provide the infrastructure needed for healthcare outreach to function. 
Keeping in mind the infrastructure survey, I selected a locally available truck and suggested retrofits to convert it into a mobile clinic. Portable and foldable modules were then designed, which could be transported in mobile clinics to set up medical camps to provide routine care to village occupants who are often deprived of routine healthcare access due to their remote nature. Applicable configurations and setups were visualized based on literature reviews and interviews with medical professionals."

I am an architect, currently enrolled as a first year student in the Master of Science in Building Performance and Diagnostics (MS-BPD) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am driven by my passion to create high quality, productive environments which incorporate sustainability in every aspect of the building delivery process and life cycle. My primary focus is the energy effectiveness of buildings in conjunction with occupant comfort and satisfaction. I hope to contribute to the building industry as well as the society and environment by applying my passion and learning in practice.
