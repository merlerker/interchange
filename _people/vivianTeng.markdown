Hi, I’m Vivian and I am currently a third year BA in architecture student with an additional major in business administration. I am interested in how I can apply the skills I have learned through business administration to help improve the architecture industry. I am currently seeking summer internship opportunities that can intertwine my interests in business and architecture together, for example but not limited to real estate or management. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me!
