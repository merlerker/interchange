project: Radiant Row House
projtext: "The radiant house redefines the interactions between a user and their physical environment through its shape and materiality. It finds its inspiration from the local surroundings: Its spatial layout mimics the Pittsburgh row house typology; the tectonic qualities come from a combination of folded rock geologies and surrounding flora bark ecologies. The walls are embedded with the hot water radiant water system that not only act as service but also as structure. The material is sand-based concrete,  3D-printed directly onto the site then lifted into place to generate texture and edible landscapes in-between. The wall is structurally optimized to reduce material volume, leaving interior cavities for occupation by humans and animals alike. New interiors come to fruition, the interior of the home, the interior of the wall, and the interior of the space between two row houses. This house engages its occupants with new understandings of tactility, ecology and geology."

Hello my name is Gil Jang, I am a graduating B.Arch Student hoping to find a full time job. I am the editor in chief of an architecture journal: interÂ·punct. Although I love to write I prefer allow drawings and spaces to talk for themselves. I was born in Michigan but raised in South Korea.
