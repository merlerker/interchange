project: Weather Museum
projtext: "The purpose of the museum of weather on a macro scale is to act as a preliminary filter for the Allegheny River, and on a micro-scale to harness and filter more intensely a fraction of the water to be the source of greywater for the buildingâ€™s plumbing needs. 
The architecture serves as an indexical interpretation of the living machine in which it does not use the compartmentalized logic of the living machine, but rather explodes this logic into one structure that utilizes the living roof and walls to pull the polluted water into different levels of purification. The journey of the occupant mimics the movement of water throughout the architecture through experiences of texture and varying ground planes to create both an educational and sensory experience.

I am a fourth-year student from Queens, NY currently pursuing a five-year B.S. Architecture degree at Carnegie Mellon University. My architectural education is the framework through which I engage with discourse addressing the challenges of today. Outside of my architectural studies, my identity as a first generation Chinese-American has led me to pursue a minor in Chinese Studies, and my curiosity towards the intersection between human behavior, design, and technology has led me to pursue a minor in Human-Computer Interaction.
