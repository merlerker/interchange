My name is Michael Longo and I am a fifth year Architecture student in my last semester of my education. I am excited to start an internship in a collaborative working environment that fosters development, mentoring and creativity. I am suited to take direction, work hard, communicate clearly, and build relationships. I am highly motivated to gain experience and work toward certification and licensure in the discipline of architecture. I have worked several summers as an assistant designer for an advertising company, and one as a freelance architect, creating a 3d model and renders of a future South Side Flats studio space. In my time at CMU I have also explored my interest in photography and will graduate with a minor in this field.
