I am from Inner Mongolia, China and currently a fifth-year architecture student in the B.Arch Program. I have always been interested in working on transportation oriented public projects and have been working as an intern in three firms (Perkins + Will, GBBN and Richard Bloch Architect). I believe the only way to solve current major global problems (i.e., global warming, inequality and population problems .etc) is to call more attention for the PHYSICAL built environment from the general public.
