project: "Designing ProCompassion: Conceptualizing Destigmatized Spaces for Independent Abortion Providers"
projtext: "Abortion providers in many regions of the US currently operate in a restrictive political climate, despite protections under federal law. In response, the restrictive geographies and defensive spaces of clinics threaten healthcare access, emotional wellbeing, and social mobility of individuals with female-assigned reproductive systems. What is the role of architecture in ensuring safe, secure access to these vital procedures? Historically, designers have done little to acknowledge these spaces or envision alternatives to the fortress-like security strategies currently in place at clinics nationwide. This thesis seeks to advocate for the independent providers that serve a critical presence in areas deemed too risky for established organizations like Planned Parenthood (PP) to operate. Though PP dominates discussions of abortion in the media, indie clinics perform about 60% of the countryâ€™s abortion procedures. These clinics have virtually no political power, forcing them to rely on more grassroots organization. While their presence is precarious, they have a level of flexibility and softness to their image, which offers architects the potential to design contextually meaningful and compassionate spaces to continue reducing stigma, healing trauma, and creating dignity for patients.

I have identified Erie, Pennsylvania, a former industrial city, as a promising location to integrate an indie clinic into its current cultural and technological redevelopment. Offering comprehensive, but contested services such as abortion and gender-affirming care in a politically divided city like Erie is a strategic move to alleviate dependence on the nearest provider in Pittsburgh, about three hours away. In addition to proposing a design for a new clinic, this thesis projects a level of grassroots organization where design is not limited entirely by budget or local opposition. It proposes a spatial response to the threat of anti-choice action, and the stigma an individual feels about their personal choice as a result. By sensitively curating a sequence through the building free from hostile buildings, spaces, and surfaces, more procompassionate ideas form in our subconscious, with the potential of stigma-shifting local associations to abortion clinics.

I am a 5th-year BArch undergraduate, also pursuing a gender studies minor. I am passionate about creating socially responsible, mindful, and healing spaces. Seeking a position at an architecture firm, that will enhance my current skill set, broaden my understanding of design theory and implementation, and provide me the experiences to pursue my goal of licensure.
