projtext: "Embedded in an ecological hillside, the co-house focuses on taking advantage of landslides that occur in Pittsburgh due to heavy rain. The central greenhouse and co-housing rooftops collect mud and water and redirects it over, through, and around the architecture, allowing occupants to directly interact with the environment around them."

My name is Colleen Duong and I am a fifth year B.Arch student and a first year MSSD student. I was born and raised in Hawai'i, which taught me to value the importance of the culture and natural beauty that surrounds me. As they say in Hawai’i, “mālama i ka ‘āina” which means to “respect and care for the land.” I want to grow as an architect and create meaningful and impactful architecture for people by utilizing the natural resources surrounding us and creating designs that allows for the voices of the community to be heard.
