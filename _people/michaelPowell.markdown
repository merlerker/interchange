project: "too little TOO MUCH"
projtext: "The discipline of architecture has been criticized time-and-time again for its reliance on visual understandings of space and access by the minds like Kat Holmes and Ellen Lupton. The thesis builds upon these concerns as it looks to reevaluate design strategies to be more sensory conscious in our practices to be more inclusive of people with Sensory Processing Challenges. By questioning existing methods of practice we can hope to get passed the assumptions made by designers based on personal experience, and to understand accessibility as being more nuanced than the handrail and the ramp. Through conversations being guided by the spectrum of sensory preferences we can propose occupancies that invite more comfortable learning, eating and living environments.

In approaching sensitivities as unique, and as a means to celebrate people, we can design a neighborhood model in Logan, Utah that provides opportunities for long-term housing developments, community programming, and occupational therapy. We can understand the physical and environmental occupations across the site as a gradient that enables self-regulated interactions. Inviting a spectrum of stimulation and engagement alongside areas of selective withdrawal allows for an embrace of varying experiences when designing more sensitive spaces regardless of sensory preference."

I am a Fifth-Year B.Arch candidate interested in learning about the relationships between material explorations and design practices. More specifically, my Graduating Thesis is focused reevaluating our approach to design through an increased sensitivity to how the manifestation of built space can impact people with Sensory Processing Challenges. My goal is to further develop these strategies in a professional practice.
