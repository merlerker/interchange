project: "Eco-Morphology"
projtext: "Environmental forms and feedback is a design studio that focuses on developing analytical thinking on urban environment and envisioning a positive relationship between architecture form and environment. 
This studio emphasizes the workflow of designing with the feedback of environment and ecology by cooperating with a series simulation and visualization tools. By developing and shaping forms according to environmental feedback, architecture can build a symbiotic relationship with landform, vegetation and lager scale urban ecology. 
In this project, I aimed to balance natural landscape and man made green infrastructure by merging the architecture into nature. While symbiotically growing with native landscape and weather, the museum creates a sharing identity by collaborating with nature and symbolize the transformation of ecology."
