goal: Internship
project: Clam Colony
projtext: "Under the direction of Sarah Rafson and Mary-Lou Arscott, as part of the Critical Cyborg Studio, my section and I were assigned to create habitats for local creatures to inhabit the Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge and the Allegheny River below.

Clubshell Mussels, a local endangered species of freshwater mollusks, were my chosen creature. Process drawings (above) show the mussels, their way of living, and their needs in a built intervention. The proposed plan (below) shows how their habitat preferences are achieved. 

Freshwater mussels, which used to inhabit the river, were almost driven to extinction by river-impoundment, embankment, and dredging, as well as water pollution. To allow these creatures to re-inhabit the space, the flow of the water must be broken, and sometimes blocked in case high levels of pollution are sensed up-stream. 

In addition to allowing us to study environment and inter-species interaction,  this project forced us to discuss animal agency, and our responsibility to other creatures around us. 

Skills: Photoshop, Illustrator, Rhino6, Freehand Drawing"

I'm a first year B.Arch student looking for internships in architecture or construction for the summer of 2021. Before college, I focused my time on volunteer efforts to build and improve community. At architecture school, that dream is shifting from non-profit community engagement into the realm of the built environment. Along with a broad set of interests in residential, civic and educational architectures, construction and planning, I hold a broad set of digital, analog, language, and professional skills.
