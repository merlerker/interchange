project: "Environmental Charter School"
projtext: "Studio 48-305: Integration Studio: Advanced Construction, was tasked with the design of a new school, for the Environmental Charter School, local to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ECS has strong commitments to equity/diversity and sustainability.  Their guiding principles are catalyst, character, collaboration, and commitment. My goal for this project was to satisfy the needs of the client and maintain contextual responsibility as a designer. I did this by designing a building fit for the neighborhood’s streetscape on the exterior, and modeled after the school’s core values on the interior. My design concept was centered around \"a city within a school\" to foster interpersonal relationships."

My name is Alyssa Mayorga, I am a fourth-year in the Bachelor of Architecture degree at CMU. I am from White Plains, New York and currently reside in Chesapeake, Virginia.  I am pursuing licensure with 300 AXP hours currently logged. My professional goal is to become a licensed architect and senior project manager in an established architecture or construction firm. I am driven to lead large groups in the development of the built environment. I would like to liaise between designers, contractors, and owners who make up the network that materializes construction projects while maintaining the essence of design initiatives.
