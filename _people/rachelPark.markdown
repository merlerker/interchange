Hello! My name is Rachel and my dream is to become a designer for the people-centered world. In my journey to find my own style and voice, I am finding ways to output my creativity and ultimately manifest it into a true career. Many of my interests include music, photography, and comics. However, instead of just liking them for the pretty sounds, pictures, and drawings, I take the time to really appreciate and understand the creative minds and talents that come together to develop works of art. I find that hobbies can be ways of learning in addition to just being things that we may like and have set myself goals to be able to explore these different opportunities throughout my career.
