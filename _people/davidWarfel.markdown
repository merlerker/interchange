projtext: "This project analyzes the relationship between different species of animals and habitats as they strive to survive and coexist on the Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh, PA.

This project was created between our studio in which each person had a different species. 

In order to create a complex bee tunnel habitat I tried to learn the basics of Grasshopper and this was overlaid on a Rhino model of the Smithfield Street Bridge."

I am currently a first year student in the CMU architecture program and am interested in finding an internship. Areas I am interested in include sustainability, new technologies that push what was previously unimaginable in the field, and contemporary architecture. Designing and building things has always been an interest of mine and is the main reason I am drawn to architecture as I can push my limits in design while also creating permanent works.
