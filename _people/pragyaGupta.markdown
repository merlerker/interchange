Hey, I am a Master of Science in Sustainable Design student. I am interested in exploring adaptive strategies and their integration with the built form through the biomimetic design process. I am currently working on developing a tool that provides visual feedback of the environmental interactions on building facade to enable designers to develop environmentally responsive facade designs.

I am interested in internship opportunities with an architectural firm where I can work on an integrated design approach through exploration and simulation. I am especially interested in working on passive design strategies for energy conservation.
