projtext: "A semester long project exploring Pittsburgh’s shortfall of Affordable Housing units, with it’s topography further challenging those in need of accesible housing. This project proposes a high rise, universal design based affordable housing alternative.

The proposed architectural solution is situated in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, which has been affected by gentrification.
Our group of 3 developed our own precise program based on our clients brief and our site analysis of the neighborhood. For the next 15 weeks we undertook this design project with our specific goals towards social design and building efficiency. We worked through the building systems and design to create a full Revit model and a compiled CD set by the end of the semester which included plans, elevations, sections, site details, and building details.

My name is Swetha Tulluri, and I am currently pursuing my last year in the Bachelor of Architecture program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently pursuing opportunities for full-time designer roles after my graduation in May 2021. I am interested in designing buildings which maintain it’s integrity throughout the development of the design; that stay true to their design concept, structure, and materiality from a larger to smaller scale.
