goal: Internship
project: “Living Woods” - Layered Landscape Infrastructure
projtext: "The proposal is an infrastructure that integrates housing with four constructed landscapes: a dense linear forest, an agrarian canopy, an understory park and cliff housing. 
The project is located at the northern edge of Sharpsburg. The narrow neighborhood is sandwiched between Allegheny river on the south and a highway at the foot of a cliff-like hill to the north. It lacks accessible green space. And the adjacent highway is a source of noise and air pollution. The proposed infrastructure and housing complex layers different landscapes on the edge of the highway to buffer the neighborhood and provide a variety of spaces for the community and storm-water management. 
Much like the hillside that provides a buffer to the neighborhood above the highway, my layered infrastructure provides a buffer to the neighborhood below the highway. The dense forest biome to the north works as a buffer providing sound and air filtration. The agrarian biome at the canopy level integrates urban farming with the housing to provide the community garden plots as well as a potential source of income for the complex which can help subsidize the housing. The ground level understory biome manages storm-water and accommodates public parks. The cliff biome to the south stacks dwelling units eight stories high. The massing of the housing in two rows responds to the water flow from the hill above and street intersections below to connect the park with the neighborhood. The distribution also allows for solar access to all the units as well as permitting cross ventilation. 
Like a forest this form is able to provide layers of vegetation and inhabitation.. This project gives the experience of being in woods and the farm in the city."

I am currently a first year student in the Master of Architecture. My interests include High Performance Building design. For which I am focusing on sustainable architecture and computational architecture courses through studies. I want my work to thrive in an interdisciplinary environment that fosters creativity and responsiveness towards energy efficiency of the building. 
I am interested in internship opportunities with an architectural firm where I can work on an integrated design approach through exploration and simulation. I am especially interested in working on climate responsive design strategies for energy conservation.
