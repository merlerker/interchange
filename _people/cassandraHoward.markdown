project: Center For Land Use Reparations
projtext: "As of 2018, Puerto Rico imported 85% of its goods, only producing 15% on the island. After Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico suffered from a lack of access to fresh produce. The Department of Agriculture in Puerto Rico has been working to support local production to reduce the number of imported foods to 65% As we have learned from Indigenous populations, localizing production is one of the most sustainable and resilient ways of life. 

The Center for Land Use Reparations situates itself in Puerto Rico, on a campus of Laboratories for Loudreaders, to teach the future land-use activists and agriculturalists how to relocalize their production and build upon Indigenous practices that are a part of the rich culture of Puerto Rico. The curriculum is divided into three parts. The first year teaches the history of land use and economic systems. The second year focuses on research for sustainable food production practices. The third year is focused on community through active participation of the local community and the students in learning and practicing local food production. 

Inspired by siloesque forms of agrarian icons, the Hypersilo rises up out of ground to bring the community together in the fight for local production and equity.

The loudreader tradition is inspired by the tobacco workers that hired one of their own, who could read, to read to them during the entire workday while they rolled cigars. The books that the lectores read for the workers were mostly books of philosophy or literature that shared an anti-capitalist imagination.

Cassandra Howard is passionate about bridging contemporary architecture practice and activism. This is a cause she has pursued throughout her architecture studies at Carnegie Mellon University over the past four years and through several community-engaged projects outside of the studio. She believes in the power of design as a tool for liberation and social and environmental justice for marginalized communities. As a designer, she works with and alongside communities, empowering individuals with the resources they need to improve their quality of life and build value in their communities. She will graduate this May with her Bachelor of Architecture degree.
