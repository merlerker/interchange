I am a passionate, self-motivating individual who is seeking opportunities for the junior architect position. I hope to utilize this opportunity to establish a strong foundation in the development of my architecture career. I work well in groups and contribute innovative ways of thinking. When need to, I take on a leadership role in the team and take on responsibilities.
