project: "Teatrul Perete Aparator"
projtext: "Teatrul Perete Aparator sits across from the corner of the historic city wall. The protective functionality of the bastion wall was reinterpreted to erect a wall that defend the theatre from external disturbance. This wall that runs linearly along the main boulevard embraces the boulevard and turns the boulevard into a mediating space between the wall and the theatre during peak performance seasons. The public circulates along the organic ramp that connects the foyers of the three theatres. The ramp, resembling the river that existed on site, restructures itself in relation with the number of intended occupants."

I am a passionate, self-motivating individual who is seeking opportunities for the junior architect position. I hope to utilize this opportunity to establish a strong foundation in the development of my architecture career. I work well in groups and contribute innovative ways of thinking. When need to, I take on a leadership role in the team and take on responsibilities.
