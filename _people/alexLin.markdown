project: "DE_CON 01: Deconstructing Blight"
projtext: "Deconstructing Blight, completed as part of the 2018-2019 Urban Design Build Studio cohort, deals with a multitude of issues and complex relationships that are implicit in the vocabulary utilized. The body of work executed explores these relationships in regards to both what blight and deconstruction mean in the context of the built environment. The phrase is explored in several ways:
1. Deconstructing blight in the conceptual sense of breaking apart the story of blight, understanding its scale and impact, and how to leverage urban blight to affect positive change.
2. Deconstructing blight in the physical sense of understanding how to take apart buildings, gathering data on the yield of deconstruction of different materials, and experiencing the energy necessary and complications of deconstructing a building 
3. Deconstructing blight in the representation sense of learning the environmental/economic/social benefits of deconstruction over demolition, and advocating for deconstruction in the context of providing living wage job opportunities through job-skills training as well as in the context of mainstream building take-down practices by prototyping a regulatory documentation set that could be submitted for permitting in an urban context."

I am currently a fifth year student in the Bachelor of Architecture expecting to graduate this May with an additional minor in Intelligent Environments. My interests include sustainable design, urban design, community-based design, and public interest design. I want my work to thrive in an interdisciplinary environment that fosters creativity and to advocate for change through design work and thinking. On campus, I have been involved in Freedom By Design as a Director/member as well as cultural performances as a choreographer and actor. In my free time, I enjoy digital fabrication, origami, piano, cardistry, and martial arts.
