My name is Zehui Li and I started my M.Arch program from Sep. 2019 until May 2021. So far, I have been equipped with international design experience and advanced BIM expertise. My Focus includes integration of emerging technologies and best design practices to enhance building performance, sustainability, ROI, and improve human experience in the built environment.
