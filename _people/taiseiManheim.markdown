project: Weather Museum
projtext: "This project is located on an island called 6 Mile Island in the Allegheny River.  One of the most interesting parts of the island is that it is an alluvial island, which means that it moves over time.  My design for the weather museum consists of a series of programs spread out over the island that anchor certain parts of the island. The areas of the island that are not anchored would slowly erode over time and eventually the island would transform into several smaller islands. The idea of a dynamic architecture and island helps to depict the effects of natural elements such as the river and the weather. People going several times over a long period of time would get a different experience each time. 

Because the island would be splitting into multiple islands, I organized the structure of the building in a rhizomatic manner. Guittari describes the rhizome as a relationship that operates similar to that of roots. They spread with no direction or a start and end, unlike a tree structure that has a starting point and branches out from there. The walls for each of the dispersed programs are filled with algae encased in layers of ETFE that are held up with a large structure.  The density of the structure is determined by the amount of sunlight on the surface, which was mapped with a DIVA sunlight simulation.  The differences in density of the structure allows for more sunlight in some areas than others, while allowing algae to grow easier in certain areas."
