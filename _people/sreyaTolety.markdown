Hello! I'm Sreya, a first year MSSD student. I am interested in the exploration of the dichotomy that exists between energy efficiency and human comfort in the built environment, and choose to do this via performance-based evaluation and simulation.
I am currently working on material science research that relates to the optimization of facade systems through kinetics and the robotic fabrication of recycled construction blocks. I am also developing a tool that analyses the life-cycle assessment of a particular material from the site to the source. Sustainability is something that comes very naturally to me, and I would love to work in a space that values it above all.
