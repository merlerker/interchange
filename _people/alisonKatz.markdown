project: "RE_CON 01 + 02"
projtext: "RE_CON is a broad housing strategy being developed by the Carnegie Mellon University Urban Design Build Studio and Project RE_ in partnership with East Liberty Development Incorporated(ELDI). The goal of RE_CON is to deconcentrate poverty and combat gentrification in Pittsburghâ€™s blighted neighborhoods by fostering the development of healthy, mixed income communities. Collaboration since 2017 has led to the development of an economic model which leverages new market tax credits and distributes profits from the sale of market rate homes to stabilize existing residents through rehabilitation projects and retrofits. The project works in tandem with DE_CON, a program to harvest materials through deconstruction which will incorporate job skill training in order to provide individuals access to a living wage and a second chance to sustain themselves. These two programs are inextricably linked and feed into each other as we strive to retain existing residents whilst bringing new community members in to create a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable neighborhood. This project was built off of the work done previously by the 2017-2018 UDBS Cohort in partnership with ELDI. 

The 2018-2019 UDBS Cohort designed two market rate homes schedule for construction on two vacant lots, owned by ELDI 315 and 317 N. St. Clair St. Because this project is designed to be scaled, it is important that the design of the houses contribute to the culture of the neighborhood, and acknowledge the context."

I am a current fifth year thesis student in the Bachelor of Architecture program. A love of art, science, activism, and humanitarianism is what lead me to study architecture. Creating systematic change that protects the most vulnerable communities within our cities and towns is what really drives me, and there are countless ways to do this within the architecture field. My goal is to enact permanent change that creates an environment that emphasizes equity through empathy and the built environment.
