project: Chicken House
projtext: "Collaborator: Louis Antonio Suarez

The house evolves from the Pennsylvania bank barn embedded in a hill with the entrance at the top. The lower level becomes a garden for chickens and the upper a house for human dwellers. The house is centered around a hearth and chimney, providing warmth and acting as a thermal mass. The Chicken House seeks to examine a new form of pastoral urban life, incorporating a human/non-human co-sharing dialectic, as a contemporary ecological thought moves to include other species. The clients are a farmer-gardener, her family, and a family of chickens. Here, the co-operative farmhouse for pan-species dwellers lies between Hazelwood Greenway and suburban neighborhood."
