I am Deepanshi Sheth, a registered architect from India. I am currently a second year student in the Masters of Urban Design. I have a keen interest in urban real estate design and development and I am looking forward to working on planning projects. I have over 2 years of work experience and also worked at Cooper Carry as a Planning Intern in summer 2018 in Alexandria. I am excited to work full time and implement what I have gained at CMU in the real world!
