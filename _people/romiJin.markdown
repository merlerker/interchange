I was born in New York City and am now studying in Pittsburgh as a fourth-year student pursuing a major in architecture (B.Arch) and a minor in human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in the potential of architecture to improve and discover solutions to global and current events; the integration of architecture; the simple yet contradictory nature of architecture. My curiosities include drawing, painting, design, animals, photography, music, reading, travel, food, coffee, and architecture.
