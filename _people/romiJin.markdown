goal: I am interested in a summer internship that could extend into a full-time job. I am unsure if I will be taking a job after summer, but I may be if my situation changes!
project: Wa(S)Terlily
projtext: "Waste products of industrial economies and growing populations increasingly stress our environment, causing pollution, which affects our health and degrades the environment, and climate change, resulting in rising sea levels and more extreme weather. These factors collide in the New York City waterfront where storm surges cause damaging flooding around marine transfer stations which export the city’s 20,000 tons of daily waste. Yet these areas are among the most economically desirable development sites in one of the planet’s most vibrant megacities.
In collaboration with Vanshika Gandotra, we are proposing an integrated waste treatment plant that will define water as a means of transport, eliminating a significant amount of trucks that would be needed to export residential trash and, therefore, decrease harmful greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants produced by those 2,500 collection trucks. The proposal comprises three main waste-management facilities: a floating immobile wastewater treatment plant along with a sludge treatment center, a floating co-generation plant that collects municipal solid waste from a network of sites, and an adjacent supporting material recovery facility.
Wa(s)terlily has responded with both a humanistic and experiential approach to waste processing. By combining separate cohorts together, including blue-collar and white-collar workers as well as local residents and tourists, the proposal juxtaposes them with essential infrastructure functions that have a negative stigma associated with physical proximity to the waste systems. The Wa(s)terlily provides a framework for self-sustaining sites to operate through a network of modular systems, extending past the island of Manhattan to be situated on any coast or waterfront, creating global marine networks of trash transport and water purification. Through fleets of variously sized CSO collectors, any body of water can be purified, and through fleets of variously sized incinerators, the transport of trash and the process of cogeneration can become significantly more efficient. Placing our site and the scope of these two detrimental issues in a larger context, we can anticipate how these systems can create a vast global network to work towards a sustainable future through self-sustaining cities."

My name is Romi! I am a fifth-year student pursuing a major in Architecture (B.Arch 2021) at CMU and a minor in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I was born in New York City, studied in Pittsburgh from 2016-2020, and currently reside in NYC again. I am interested in the potential of architecture to improve and discover solutions to worldwide issues (and ways of worldmaking), the integration of architecture with other fields, and the simple yet contradictory nature of architecture. My other curiosities include drawing, painting, designing, traveling, reading, photography, music, animals, and food.
