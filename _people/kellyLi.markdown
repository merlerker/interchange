Hello! I’m a fifth-year B.Arch student graduating with an additional major in Social & Political History. Recently, I’ve worked with evolveEA in Pittsburgh and WRNS Studio in San Francisco. I’m a recipient of ACS Scholars, which is awarded to 40 graduating seniors in the university, as well as the Luther S. Lashmit scholarship, which enabled me to spend a semester abroad in Berlin. On campus, I’m also an editor of the student-run architecture theory journal, inter·punct. I'm currently looking for full-time employment in New York. Please feel free to reach out, I’m always happy to have a conversation!
