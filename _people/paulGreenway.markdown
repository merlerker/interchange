project: Museum Of Weather
projtext: "Six Mile Island, a 1,000 foot island in the Allegheny river north of Pittsburgh, is the site for the proposed Museum of Weather. The project focuses on environmental data and more specifically, water purification systems as the main drivers of the design. During the early stages of the project, research about stormwater management and sewage outfalls into Pittsburgh rivers led to the use of wetland and bioswale design principles becoming integral part of the design. Rather than being placed on the existing island, the museum emerges from the terraformed landscape of the island, integrating waterways and larger wetlands into the terrain. As a result, the transformed island is able to intake polluted river and rain water simultaneously, naturally filtering it as it passes through the soil and roots."
