I am Cheng Zhou. I am the first year student of M.Arch program in CMU. I received my B.Arch degree in Zhejiang Sci-Tech University. I had an internship as an assistant architect in institute of architecture design and research, Chinese academy of sciences. I am interested in applying advanced technology in designing architecture. I took some Computational Design classes, Human-Computer Interaction classes and Computer Science classes. Personally, I am not satisfied with gorgeous projects on the paper and I always try to think about the refined relationship established by the project. Also, I am firmly convinced that design could create a significant impact on our daily life.
