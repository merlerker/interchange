An architect with a deep passion for creating a cleaner and greener world through policies, business operations and most importantly building construction. My curriculum and prior work experience has prepared me with varied skills in corporate social responsibilities, designing, modelling & certifying sustainable buildings. During my time at Carnegie Mellon University I have taken courses that have carved my skills and interests in Sustainable Operations, Building Performance Simulations, HVAC systems, Generative Modelling, Environmental Science, Daylighting and Energy Finance.
