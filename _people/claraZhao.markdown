Clara Zhao is a third year B.Arch student studying at Carnegie Mellon University. She is interested in the integration of fashion, music, and ecology through architecture. Last summer she interned for NBBJ's Shanghai studio, and is currently working as an academic coach on campus. Apart from architecture, she is also a classically trained vocalist for thirteen years (made solo appearances at Shanghai Symphony Hall and Shanghai Music Hall).
