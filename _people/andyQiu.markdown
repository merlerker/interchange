project: Vine
projtext: Vine is a post-anthropocentric construct that seeks to provide ecological relief for issues amplified by weather conditions, river flow, and sewage output on Six Mile Island. I mapped out several important pain points on the site, and created a morphological transformation of the city grid, which I then used as a formal framework for the bridge. This project brings in the question of temporality, and uses growing oyster breakwaters and embedded sycamore tree structures to provide for filtration, erosion prevention, and local bird habitation. The structure is anti-deterministic and allows for humans to create their own means of inhabiting the spaces.
