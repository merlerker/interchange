Extending the existing systems to establish a gateway to Millvale, the plan incorporates introducing an improved and a new connection to the riverfront, a park for the community and affordable housing for the new community. In order to revive and further improve the community, a new economic model for the borough is important. Practicing policies and approaches towards self-reliance and community governance would provide suitable environment to grow as a community and businesses to flourish. This led us to proposing a Local Ownership/ Import Substitution model that would empower the people of Millvale and instill a sense of community.
