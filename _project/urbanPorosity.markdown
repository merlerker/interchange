This project was to design a small office space for a 50 person startup company, that has open spaces for the community. East Liberty is a neighborhood transitioning through a gentrification period; the connection to the neighborhood is especially important in allowing the old neighborhood transition into the new. I have also included a set of technical drawings and a code review I have completed for this project.
