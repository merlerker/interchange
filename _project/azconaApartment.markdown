 This apartment was conceived as a warm yet modern home for a young couple. A simple but attractive palette of materials defined each space and gave it a unique identity. Wood, stone, touches of color and minimal arrangements were key for the remodeling of this 1970’s two stories apartment located in the south of Mexico City. The kitchen became one of the central spaces, hence the pop of color and pattern in the flooring which paired perfectlly with the warm wood floor. Another interesting space is the terrace which has a spectacular view from the 12th floor of the building. Black volcanic stone paired with greenery in a superzied planter give this apartment a place perfect to relax or to held a nice party.
