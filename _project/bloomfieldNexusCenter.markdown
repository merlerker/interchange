 Located in Bloomfield, The Bloomfield Recreation Center, pool and park is known for its adjacency to the Bloomfield Bridge. My objective for this project was to restore the ecology of the site, while promoting movement, access and connectivity.
 Solutions for the site and building were facilitated by researching the Venice Biennale and its diversity of approaches to architecture that exhibits “a generosity of spirit and a sense of humanity at the core of architecture’s agenda, focusing on the quality of space itself and the ability for architecture to pro-vide free and additional spatial gifts to those who use it and on its ability to address the unspoken wishes of strangers.”
 This project suggests sustainable water strategies for the Bloomfield Recreation Center site. The primary goal was to assess the state of hydrology on the site and to problem solve strategies that celebrate the water as a part of the nature of the park while also responsibly managing it’s destructive effects.
 This project serves as a learning tool for assessing hydrology and finding solutions applicable to the  Pittsburgh region where sewer infrastructures are unable to meet peak demands and hardscape development inhibits water from entering the ground.
