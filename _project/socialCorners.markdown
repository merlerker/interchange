Primarily focusing on reviving the commercial culture in Millvale, PA to form an iconic identity at its gateway, this project imagined that the collection of diverse local businesses of Millvaleâ€™s heyday be reintegrated into the fabric of the town. We thus proposed a series of strategically-placed low-cost, short-term events to discover the demand for commercial & recreational amenities that incrementally grow interest & incentivize long-term investment. This drives an image of a historic Millvale, while looking to its future with a unique, innovative, active community.
