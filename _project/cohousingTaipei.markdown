The right to live is a basic human right, but in China, people have to struggle for it. As one of them, I've seen too many young people reduce their quality of life in order to have a small place to live in the metropolis. Therefore, I decided to pick my site from Taipei, the city with the most serious housing problem in Taiwan, to explore the idea of an affordable and sharing community. The concept of co-housing is very new in Taiwan, therefore, I would like to explore a new scenario for building affordable housing in Taipei, changing the current top-down process of building public housing and making Housing Cooperative become a bridge between government, citizens, and other third-party organization or companies. While meeting the government's planning goals, it should also give residents and other organizations an opportunity to participate and introduce more shareable resources.
