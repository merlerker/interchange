 1.This project is aiming to bring out a
 building that is mostly felt and not
 seen. This thesis design would be
 based on 3 major principles rather
 key characteristics which are related
 to one and other, which would help
 achieve a better design for the blind
 and the visually impaired.
 Access, Space and Sensory
 awareness.
 This project is challenging because
 the users here has no idea of how
 aesthetically pleasing the place looks,
 the only concern for them would be
 the functional aspect of the space
 and if their senses are put to good
 work.
