This project is the culmination of work done for a studio in the fall of 2017 in collaboration with one other student. Located on Brunot Island just northwest of downtown Pittsburgh, the building acts as both museum and classroom for the study of Pittsburgh's rivers. Heavy emphasis was placed on material exploration and novel fabrication techniques.
